AtlasChat

Governed AI prompt control — deliberate, visible, and user-first.

AtlasChat is a governance-first browser extension that gives users explicit control over how prompts are sent to AI systems.
No silent execution. No hidden state. No backend services.

Trust… But Verify.

What AtlasChat Does

AtlasChat operates at the UI boundary and governs how prompts are handled before they are sent.

Prompt Modes

Guard Mode (PME)
Clarifies and structures user intent without executing requests.

Direct Mode (PMD)
Sends prompts exactly as written — zero mutation.

Governance by Design

Mode and domain are always visible

No silent behavior

User intent always wins (fail-open safety model)

What AtlasChat Is Not

❌ Not an AI model

❌ Not a chatbot competitor

❌ Not a backend service

❌ Not a data store

❌ Not a compliance certification

AtlasChat governs user behavior, not vendor infrastructure.
